                            different from the offline experience, as customers are not able to choose
                            the characteristics of their bouquet and have to find a match from available
                            options.

                            The order can be sent to the user or to the user, or to the receiver directly.

                    and perspectives of the users I am designing for.
                    My goal was to understand if they already order flower bouquets online
                    or not, and why. I also Wanted to know what they like and do not like about online and
                    offline experience of buying a bouquet, in addition to the options they would like to have.

                    Some pain points mentioned by the users were the complexity of ordering a bouquet online,

                    not being able to send a bouquet directly to a loved one, and not having enough time to
                    buy a bouquet offline.

                </h4>
                <p class="text-left">
                    The goal of this competitive audit is to compare the process of
                    ordering a flower bouquet of each competitive website and identifying their
                    similar or unique options.
                </p>
                <p class="text-left">
                    I understood that websites in and out of Iran have similar processes and options,
                    with some differences in details like identification, payment, and administrations.
                    As the target users are in Iran, I will focus on websites in Iran as the main competitors.
                    Most of the websites in Iran are for ordering any kinds of flowers and not just bouquets,
                    and the option of designing a bouquet is also not available. Therefore, all websites will
                    be indirect competitors and I will focus on the process of ordering a bouquet by browsing
                    available options.
                </p>

                <p class="text-left">
                    I have chosen five websites that are the top search results for various related keywords.
                    These websites are: golestan.com, vipshop.flowers, golbama.com, floriaflower.com, and
                    anguor.com.
                </p>
                <p class="text-left">
                    Most of the websites had a responsive format and images had a proper quality.
                    Providing the option of choosing the reception time, guaranteeing the quality and freshness
                    of flowers, special offers, strong customer support, and the possibility of sending orders
                    out of Iran are also some strengths of these websites. In all websites,
                    items are categorized based on types of products, types of flowers, occasions, etc. However,
                    the categories usually have overlaps and choosing the best one for finding a match with what
                    the user wants may be confusing. In addition, the huge number of options may frustrate users who
                    do not have much time. In one of the websites, in addition to categories,
                    filters are provided. Providing the user with the option to first see all the items, and then
                    remove irrelevant items by filters seems to be a simpler and faster approach.
                </p>

                <p class="text-left">
                    Providing an option for customizing designs, providing a fast and simple path for finding the best
                    bouquet, making the website fully responsive, and maintaining the order placement procedure
                    simple while still allowing the user to have options like choosing various reception information
                    are some identified opportunities.

                <p class="text-left">
                    I used design thinking activities, like How Might We and Crazy Eights,
                    to come up with design solutions for the problems that users are experiencing.
                </p>
                <p class="text-left">
                    Some questions I tried to answer are: How might we help the user have an online experience
                    of ordering a bouquet that is similar to the offline experience? (In iran, customers can choose
                    the type, color, and number of flowers. Then, the florist chooses other details and assembles the
                    bouquet). How might we make the design process of a bouquet fun and engaging? How might we
                    help the users choose the bouquets they want fast and simple? many other questions were made
                    for ideation during this step and next steps. Then, the Crazy Eights exercise was completed for
                    finding ideas and solutions.
                </p>
                <p class="text-left">
                    From here, it is assumed that an AI model which can produce an image of a bouquet based on
                    the type, color, and number of flowers of that bouquet. The use of AI models can be wider, but
                    it is limited to this model in this project to amp up the good while also keeping a
                    border for the project.

                    Designing a bouquet and completing the order.

                    The goal of this round of usability test was to see if users can complete both core tasks of
                    the Your Bouquet website, and if anything was difficult to use or understand. Some
                    research questions were: Can the users understand how filters work? Can users complete an order
                    with specific filters? Can users understand how design works? Can users complete the process
                    of designing and ordering a bouquet? Drop-off rates and conversion rates were the main KPIs of
                    this test. The test was done as an unmoderated usability study and took around 20 minutes
                    for each user. Participants were four female and one male between the ages of 20 to 60.

                    An affinity map containing grouped data from all usability study participants is created. Data
                    is grouped based on flows. Based on observation, themes and insights have been identified and
                    an action plan has been made.

                    prototype is made for

                    I had so much fun while learning many new things while working on this project.
                    However, this project has been done for practicing design thinking, and it ends here.
                    This design can be handed to programmers to be lunched after a few more iterations, especially
                    for adding accessibility. This website would help users to design their
                    own bouquet, inorder to have fun using an AI model, or to actually order the bouquet.
                    It would also help users choose the bouquets they need simply and fast.
                    In other words, it will help users show their love in a more interesting and less complicated way!

                    I learned a lot during this project, but one of the most important things that I could
                    experience was that it is really easy to be effected by a bias, or to wrongly guess
                    about what users feel, think, or mean without even noticing. It is important to identify
                    biases and to practice the rule of putting users center and front at any step. I could also
                    see how users' needs can be different from each other, or in different contexts.
